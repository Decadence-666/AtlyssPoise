# AtlyssPoise

**AtlyssPoise** is a mod for *Atlyss* that introduces a poise mechanic, inspired by the Mystic's Prism skill. It rewards tanky, high-defense builds by providing resistance to knockback, improving balance and build variety.

---

## What Does It Do?

- Adds a new **Poise** stat that scales with the player's **Defense**.
- While a player has **positive Poise**, they are immune to knockback effects.
- **Poise regenerates** when the player is out of combat.
- Poise is **automatically displayed** on the HUD with a custom bar.

## Why Poise?

The Mystic class can resist knockback thanks to Prism skill, but other classes ‚Äî especially Fighters with heavy armor ‚Äî have no built-in way to do so. This results in:

- Players often ignoring the Defense stat.
- Lack of build diversity, especially for tank-style characters.

**AtlyssPoise** encourages more diverse builds by giving **high-Defense characters a meaningful new advantage**.

## Planned Features

- Configurable Poise scaling (via config file or UI)
- Optional visual effects when Poise breaks
- Better UI design
- Balancing
